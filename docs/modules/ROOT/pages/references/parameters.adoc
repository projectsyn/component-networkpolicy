= Parameters

The parent key for all of the following parameters is `networkpolicy`.

== `labels`

[horizontal]
type:: dictionary
default::
+
[source,yaml]
----
noDefaults: network-policies.syn.tools/no-defaults
baseDefaults: network-policies.syn.tools/base-defaults
purgeDefaults: network-policies.syn.tools/purge-defaults
purgeNonBase: network-policies.syn.tools/purge-non-base
----

Name of the labels to be used in other components.

By default every namespace will get policies required for the OpenShift platform and a policy to allow intra-namespace communication.
By default, two sets of policies are created in every namespace:
- `base` policies, which are required for the OpenShift platform to function correctly.
- `default` policies, which allow pods in the same namespace to communicate with each other.
The default policies can be modified with the labels defined in this parameter.

=== `noDefaults` label

Policies will no longer be managed.
The already created policies will stay in place and can be modified by the user or other components.

=== `baseDefaults` label

Only policies required for the OpenShift platform will be created.
The intra-namespace policy will no longer be managed by this component and can be modified by the user or other components.

Pods will no longer be able to communicate with each other even if they are in the same namespace.

=== `purgeDefaults` label

All managed policies will be purged from the namespace.

=== `purgeNonBase` label

All managed policies except the platform required policies will be purged from the namespace.

[WARNING]
====
The `purge*` labels should always be acompanied by their respective `noDefaults` or `baseDefaults` label.
====

== `allowNamespaceLabels`

[horizontal]
type:: list of tuples
default:: empty list

A list of labels matching namespaces to allow traffic from.
Each list item can contain several key value pairs.
They result in an `AND` condition.
Individual list items will result in an `OR` condition.

[source,yaml]
----
allowNamespaceLabels:
  - my-label-a: true
    my-label-b: true
  - my-label-c: true
----

In the above example, traffic will be allowed if a namespaces has the label `my-label-a=true` AND `my-label-b=true`.
Traffic will also be allowed if a namespace is labeled `my-label-c`.

== `ignoredNamespaces`

[horizontal]
type:: list of strings
default:: empty list

A list of namespace names where no default NetworkPolicies will be created.
Default NetworkPolicies will be purged for all namespaces in this list.
Entries in the list can be removed by adding the entry prefixed with a `~`.

== `networkPlugin`

[horizontal]
type:: string
default:: `''`

The network plugin installed on the cluster.

[CAUTION]
====
This needs to be set when using the Cilium network plugin.
Otherwise some policies might not be applied correctly.
====

== `ciliumClusterID`

[horizontal]
type:: string
default:: `''`

This parameter controls whether the component isolates namespaces with the same name from each other in a Cilium cluster mesh.
The default behavior if the parameter is empty is to allow connectivity between namespaces with the same name across clusters.

If this behavior isn't desired, this parameter can be set to the cluster's Cilium cluster ID (which is configured in parameter `cilium.cilium_helm_values.cluster.name` when using cluster mesh).
When the parameter isn't empty, the component will adjust the `allow-from-same-namespace` policy with the following snippet:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
 ingress:
 - from:
   - podSelector:
       matchLabels:
         io.cilium.k8s.policy.cluster: <ciliumClusterID> <1>
----
<1> `<ciliumClusterID>` is replaced with the string provided in this parameter

== `allowFromNodeLabels`

[horizontal]
type:: dict
default:: `{}`

This parameter allows users to customize the `allow-from-cluster-nodes` `CiliumNetworkPolicy`.

When this parameter is empty, this policy allow access from workloads running on all cluster nodes (including nodes of other clusters in the same cluster mesh) to workloads.
This ensures that -- for example -- an ingress controller which is running in host-network mode can access workloads that are exposed through an `Ingress`.

When the parameter isn't empty, the component uses the contents as the value for `matchLabels` in a `fromNodes` entry in the `CiliumNetworkPolicy`.
This restricts access to workloads to the host network on nodes matching the provided label selector(s).
See the https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/security/policy/language/#node-based[Cilium documentation] for details on the `fromNodes` policy mechanism.

IMPORTANT: When setting a value for this parameter, you must ensure that you're using Cilium 1.16 or newer and that the Helm value `nodeSelectorLabels=true` is set for your Cilium installation.

[NOTE]
====
The `allow-from-cluster-nodes` policy always allows access to workloads in the namespace from the host on which they're running.
This ensures that the Kubernetes health checks work as expected regardless of the provided label selector.
====

[TIP]
====
For isolating access to workloads between clusters in a Cilium cluster mesh, you can label all nodes of each cluster with the cluster's Project Syn ID, for example with `kubectl label nodes --all syn.tools/cluster-id=c-the-cluster-1234`.

Then you can set this parameter as

[source,yaml]
----
allowFromNodeLabels:
  syn.tools/cluster-id: ${cluster:name}
----
====

== Example

[source,yaml]
----
# Allow traffic from ingress and monitoring
allowNamespaceLabels:
  - network.openshift.io/policy-group: monitoring
  - network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress
# Do not create the default policies in the OpenShift namespaces.
ignoredNamespaces:
  - openshift
  - openshift-apiserver
  - openshift-apiserver-operator
  - â€¦
