= Parameters

The parent key for all of the following parameters is `networkpolicy`.

== `labels`

[horizontal]
type:: dictionary
default::
+
[source,yaml]
----
noDefaults: network-policies.syn.tools/no-defaults
policySetPrefix: set.network-policies.syn.tools/
## Deprecated
# Use `base` policy set instead. e.g. `set.network-policies.syn.tools/base: ""`
baseDefaults: network-policies.syn.tools/base-defaults
## Deprecated and unused. Here for backwards compatibility as some components still include this label
purgeDefaults: network-policies.syn.tools/purge-defaults
purgeNonBase: network-policies.syn.tools/purge-non-base
----

Name of the labels to be used in other components.

By default, two sets of policies are created in every namespace:
- `base` policies, which are required for the platform to function correctly.
- `default` policies, which allow pods in the same namespace to communicate with each other.
The default policies can be modified with the labels defined in this parameter.

=== `policySetPrefix` label prefix

Custom policy sets can be applied to a namespace by adding a label with this prefix and the name of the policy set as suffix.
For example, to apply the `ingress` policy set, add the label `set.network-policies.syn.tools/ingress: ""` to the namespace.
The label value is ignored and can be an empty string.

As soon as any policy set label is applied to a namespace, the `default` policy set is removed unless it is explicitly added again using the corresponding label.

=== `noDefaults` label

Policies will no longer be managed and existing policies managed by this component will be removed in namespaces with this label.

=== `baseDefaults` label

[WARNING]
====
This label is deprecated.
Use the `set.network-policies.syn.tools/base: ""` label instead.
====

Only policies required for the OpenShift platform will be created.
The intra-namespace policy will be removed and the pods in the namespace will be isolated from each other.

=== `purgeDefaults` and `purgeNonBase` labels

Unused and have no effect.
Purging of policies is the default behavior and can't be disabled.

== `basePolicy.allowNamespaceLabels`

[horizontal]
type:: dictionary[string](list of tuples|tuples|null)
default:: `{}`
example::
+
[source,yaml]
----
allowNamespaceLabels:
  mylabel:
    - test.example.net/test-group: group1
    - test.example.net/test-group: group2
  myOtherLabel:
    test.example.net/ingress-group: "group1"
    test.example.net/ingress-group: "group2"
  myThirdLabel: null
----

The key is for easier merging in commodore and has no semantic meaning.
The value is either a list of tuples, a single tuple or `null`.
The values are a list of labels matching namespaces to allow traffic from.
Each list item can contain several key value pairs.
They result in an `AND` condition.
Individual list items will result in an `OR` condition.

In the above example, traffic will be allowed if a namespaces has the label `test.example.net/test-group=group1` OR `test.example.net/test-group=group2`.
Traffic will also be allowed if a namespace has the label `test.example.net/ingress-group=group1` AND `test.example.net/ingress-group=group2`.


== `ignoredNamespaces`

[horizontal]
type:: list of strings
default:: empty list

A list of namespace names where no default NetworkPolicies will be created.
Default NetworkPolicies will be purged for all namespaces in this list.
Entries in the list can be removed by adding the entry prefixed with a `~`.

== `basePolicy.cniPlugins.cilium.allowFromNodeLabels`

[horizontal]
type:: dict
default:: `{}`

This parameter allows users to customize the `allow-from-cluster-nodes` `CiliumNetworkPolicy`.

When this parameter is empty, this policy allow access from workloads running on all cluster nodes (including nodes of other clusters in the same cluster mesh) to workloads.
This ensures that -- for example -- an ingress controller which is running in host-network mode can access workloads that are exposed through an `Ingress`.

When the parameter isn't empty, the component uses the contents as the value for `matchLabels` in a `fromNodes` entry in the `CiliumNetworkPolicy`.
This restricts access to workloads to the host network on nodes matching the provided label selector(s).
See the https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/security/policy/language/#node-based[Cilium documentation] for details on the `fromNodes` policy mechanism.

IMPORTANT: When setting a value for this parameter, you must ensure that you're using Cilium 1.16 or newer and that the Helm value `nodeSelectorLabels=true` is set for your Cilium installation.

[NOTE]
====
The `allow-from-cluster-nodes` policy always allows access to workloads in the namespace from the host on which they're running.
This ensures that the Kubernetes health checks work as expected regardless of the provided label selector.
====

[TIP]
====
For isolating access to workloads between clusters in a Cilium cluster mesh, you can label all nodes of each cluster with the cluster's Project Syn ID, for example with `kubectl label nodes --all syn.tools/cluster-id=c-the-cluster-1234`.

Then you can set this parameter as

[source,yaml]
----
allowFromNodeLabels:
  syn.tools/cluster-id: ${cluster:name}
----
====

== `policies`

[horizontal]
type:: dict
default:: `{}`

Define additional NetworkPolicies or CiliumNetworkPolicies to be used by policy sets.

[NOTE]
====
Make sure to use the prefix `cilium/` when defining CiliumNetworkPolicies.
====

Also see xref:how-tos/using-customizing-policies.adoc[].

== `policySets`

[horizontal]
type:: dict
default:: `{}`

Define policy sets that can be selected by the label `network-policies.syn.tools/policy-sets`.
A policy set is an array of policy names defined in `policies`.
Names can be removed from the default policy sets by prefixing them with a `~`.
A policy can be part of multiple policy sets, even if those policy sets are applied to the same namespace.

Also see xref:how-tos/using-customizing-policies.adoc[].
